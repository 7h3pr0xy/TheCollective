# Yet Another Collection of Kali Linux Scripts
##Disclaimer: I dont recommend or condone using anything on here to anyone else for any reason. The scipts here may work, but most likely will break a system they are run on. If you use them you do so at your own risk. I do/have NEVER authorized,condoned, or recommend the use of anything in any of my repos for any reason. This is a collection of simple scripts I found useful with my own Kali OS for educational purposes only. I did not create any of the scripts downloaded via the shell scripts. All credit goes to the authors whos full URL or github account is listed in the script, please see their sites for more info.

##Helpful CMDs:
