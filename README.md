# Collection of Kali Linux Scripts

Simple Scripts I found useful with Kali. Some I made, some I didnt.

This is more of a repo for my own use that im sharing with everyone and so I can look them up when I burn my kali image every so often.

#Disclaimer: I dont recommend using anything on here to anyone else for any reason. Scipts here my work, but most likely will break a system they are run on.
