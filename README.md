# Collection of Kali Linux Scripts

This is a collection of simple scripts I found useful with my own Kali OS. Some I made, some I didnt. This is more of a repo for my own use that im sharing with everyone and so I can look them up when I burn my kali image every so often.

###Disclaimer: I dont recommend using anything on here to anyone else for any reason. Scipts here may work, but most likely will break a system they are run on. If you use them you do so at your own risk.
