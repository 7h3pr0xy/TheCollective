# Collection of Kali Linux Scripts

This is a collection of simple scripts I found useful with my own Kali OS. This is more of a repo for my own use that im sharing with everyone. Most of the scripts simply make using commands in Kali easy for people.

###Disclaimer: I dont recommend using anything on here to anyone else for any reason. Scipts here may work, but most likely will break a system they are run on. If you use them you do so at your own risk.
