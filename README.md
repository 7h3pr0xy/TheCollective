# Collection of Kali Linux Scripts

This is a collection of simple scripts I found useful with my own Kali OS. This is more of a repo for my own use that im sharing with everyone. Most of the scripts simply make using commands in Kali easy for people.

###Disclaimer: I dont recommend using anything on here to anyone else for any reason. Scipts here may work, but most likely will break a system they are run on. If you use them you do so at your own risk. Also NEVER use anything in any of my repos to attempt or break into anything that you do not own.

##CMDs
Scan Wifi: iw wlan0 scan
