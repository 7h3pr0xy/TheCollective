# Yet Another Collection of Kali Linux Scripts
##Disclaimer: I dont recommend or condone using anything on here to anyone else for any reason. The scipts here may work, but most likely will break a system they are run on. If you use them you do so at your own risk. Also I do/have NEVER authorized,condone, or recommend the use of anything in any of my repos for any reason. This is a collection of simple scripts I found useful with my own Kali OS for educational purposes only. I did not create any of the scripts downloaded via the shell scripts. ALl credit goes the the authors whos full URL or github account is listed in the script.

##Helpful CMDs:
