# Yet Another Collection of Kali Linux Scripts
##Disclaimer: I dont recommend or condone using anything on here to anyone else for any reason. The scipts here may work, but most likely will break a system they are run on. I told you here. If you use them you do so at your own risk. Also I do/have NEVER authorized or recommend the use of anything in any of my repos to attempt to break/hack/pen-test/gain acces to/etc into anything that you do not own for any reason. This is a collection of simple scripts I found useful with my own Kali OS. This is more of a repo for my own use that im sharing with everyone to learn from and/or contribute to.

##TODO:
- Work towards making the scripts geared towards running from a live image, making easy and quick spin up and run kali

##Helpful CMDs:
Scan Wifi info: iw wlan0 scan
